## Dev Ops

### Automated CHANGELOG.md Management

To streamline release management, the project uses automation to update `CHANGELOG.md` on every significant change. This is achieved through CI/CD workflows that detect commits following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) and trigger scripts to append or update release notes. This ensures that the changelog remains accurate and up-to-date without manual intervention.

### Automatic Versioning

The project employs automatic semantic versioning using tools like [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/) or custom scripts. These tools analyze commit messages to determine if a major, minor, or patch version bump is required, then update version numbers across relevant files (e.g., `package.json`, documentation headers) and create a new release tag.

#### Project Global Semantic Versioning

A global version is maintained for the entire project, ensuring consistency across all modules and scripts. The version is stored in a central configuration file (e.g., `.version` or `package.json`) and referenced by scripts and CI/CD pipelines to enforce uniformity.

```

- **Settings:** Versioning and changelog automation are configured in `.github/workflows/release.yml` and project settings files.
- **Scripts:** New scripts in the `scripts/` directory handle version bumping, changelog generation, and release tagging.
- **Extensibility:** The architecture allows easy integration of additional automation tasks as the project grows.

This Dev Ops setup ensures reliable, transparent, and maintainable release processes for Script Vault.
